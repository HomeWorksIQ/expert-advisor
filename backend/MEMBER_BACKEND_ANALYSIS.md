## RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### 1. **Create Member Authentication Service**
```python
# Create: /app/backend/member_auth_service.py
class MemberAuthService:
    async def register_member(email, password, profile_data)
    async def login_member(email, password)
    async def verify_email(token)
    async def reset_password(email)
    async def change_password(member_id, old_password, new_password)
```

### 2. **Create Member Profile Service**
```python
# Create: /app/backend/member_profile_service.py
class MemberProfileService:
    async def get_member_profile(member_id)
    async def update_member_profile(member_id, profile_data)
    async def get_member_dashboard(member_id)
    async def get_member_favorites(member_id)
    async def add_favorite_expert(member_id, expert_id)
```

### 3. **Extend Database Models**
```python
# Add to database_models.py
class MemberRegistration(BaseModel):
    email: str
    password: str
    firstName: str
    lastName: str
    agreesToTerms: bool
    emailVerificationToken: Optional[str]

class MemberSession(BaseModel):
    memberId: str
    sessionToken: str
    expiresAt: datetime
    deviceInfo: Optional[str]
```

### 4. **Add Core Member Endpoints to server.py**
```python
# Member Authentication Routes
@api_router.post("/members/register")
@api_router.post("/members/login")
@api_router.post("/members/logout")
@api_router.post("/members/verify-email")
@api_router.post("/members/forgot-password")

# Member Profile Routes
@api_router.get("/members/{member_id}/profile")
@api_router.put("/members/{member_id}/profile")
@api_router.get("/members/{member_id}/dashboard")
```

## CURRENT AFFILIATE/CREDITS INTEGRATION

The affiliate program and credits system is already well-implemented and ready for member integration:

### ✅ **Already Working:**
- Members can create affiliate accounts
- Credit earning from referrals ($10 per signup)
- Credit spending in shopping cart (up to 50% of purchase)
- Credit transaction history
- Referral tracking and statistics

### ❓ **Integration Needs:**
- Connect member registration to affiliate signup processing
- Link member profile to credit account creation
- Integrate member dashboard with affiliate stats
- Connect member favorites to expert booking flow

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of what needs to be implemented to have a complete member backend system.
