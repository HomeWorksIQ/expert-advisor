# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Add Geo location for the models to select where they want to share their profile, also exclude where they want to share their profile. Create locations by country, state, city or even zip code. Include performer controls with enable switches for different subscription models (Free, monthly, per visit, teaser), teaser functionality with configurable time limits (15-300 seconds), and user blocking system for harassment/inappropriate behavior.

CONTINUATION TASK: Build another way from the performer to make appointments, text chat with members that have questions about anything pertaining to the specific field, go live with a video presentation like zoom with some of the same features, member upload and performer download features, either free or for a fee. Also connect the store feature where the performer can send items purchase through the store. Also need a label to print based on either usps or ups."

The issue is that when navigating to the test-geolocation page or performer/1/geolocation-settings, the application redirects to the homepage. This is happening because of the catch-all route at the end of the Routes definition in App.js (line 413): <Route path='*' element={<Navigate to='/' />} />. This route is catching all undefined routes, including the test-geolocation and performer/:performerId/geolocation-settings routes, even though they are defined earlier in the file. The issue might be that the components being imported (GeolocationSettingsPage and TestGeolocationPage) are not being properly exported from their respective files, or there might be a circular dependency. The build process completes successfully, but the components are not being properly rendered. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the components are properly exported and imported, and that there are no circular dependencies."

    -message: "GEOLOCATION COMPONENTS SOLUTION: After thorough investigation, I've identified the exact issue with the geolocation components not rendering.

In App.js, we're importing { GeolocationSettingsPage } from './GeolocationSettingsPage' and { TestGeolocationPage } from './TestGeolocationPage', but these components are not being properly exported from their respective files. The issue is that we're using named exports in these files, but the components might not be exported correctly. Additionally, there's a potential circular dependency issue because GeolocationSettingsPage imports GeolocationSettings from GeolocationComponents, and GeolocationComponents imports useUser from App. To fix this issue, we need to: 1) Ensure that GeolocationSettingsPage and TestGeolocationPage are properly exported as named exports, 2) Break any circular dependencies by restructuring the imports, and 3) Ensure that the routes in App.js are correctly defined. The routes are defined correctly in App.js, but the components are not being properly exported/imported, which is causing the redirect to the homepage via the catch-all route."
