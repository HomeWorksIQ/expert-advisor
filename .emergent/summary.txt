The previous AI engineer successfully initiated development from an MVP codebase, prioritizing user requests chronologically. Initially, the engineer focused on frontend UI modifications, specifically removing search functionalities from the homepage and integrating a Search Now button linking to a category page, which were validated through testing. Following this, significant backend development was undertaken to introduce an affiliate program, credits system, and expert payout functionality, including new models and services. This also required recreating the discover page with extensive search parameters and linking it to an enhanced backend search endpoint. A core part of the work involved implementing a comprehensive member authentication and profile management system. While many backend functionalities were implemented and tested, some inconsistencies and Not Found errors for member profile, dashboard, and related endpoints were observed during subsequent preview tests. The last major task involved building out the admin backend, where core functionalities like admin login, user listing, financial overview, and analytics were successfully implemented, but a user search endpoint failed, indicating the current state of work. The engineer's approach involved incremental development, thorough testing, and direct engagement with the user for clarification and confirmation at critical junctures.

The user initiated the project with a series of modifications to an existing application. The primary goals were:
1.  **Homepage Redesign**: Remove existing search bars and criteria from the front page, while retaining Welcome to The Experts and the image of professionals. A Search Now button, linking to the category page, should be placed below The Experts.
2.  **Affiliate Program**: Implement a system where members receive service credits when new users sign up via their unique referral link. These credits should be usable as a payment method within the shopping cart.
3.  **Expert Payouts**: Develop functionality for experts to request funds into their bank accounts through the platform's payment system.
4.  **Enhanced Search Flow**: Integrate the category page with a redesigned discover page. The discover page needs comprehensive search criteria (location, expert type, status, experience levels, sort by), pre-selecting the chosen category. Search results should be displayed either on the same page or a new results page, with an option for new searches. The category page background should be light blue.
5.  **Data Accuracy & Linking**: Ensure all mock expert profiles have unique names and that booking, chat, and profile links function correctly. The search experts button on the discover page must accurately reflect the number of experts based on location criteria (national, user's location, or zip code). The My Location button should display the user's geo-IP detected city.
6.  **Core Member Backend**: Implement fundamental member functionalities including email/password registration, login, logout, comprehensive profile management (CRUD), a member dashboard with activity tracking, and a favorites system for experts. These should integrate with the existing affiliate and credits systems.
7.  **Admin Backend**: Develop core administrative functionalities including admin authentication (login/logout), a user management dashboard, a basic financial overview, an expert approval system, and platform analytics.

-   Full resolution of member profile management, dashboard, and favorites API endpoints that consistently returned Not Found errors during preview testing.
-   Fixing the User not found error for the admin user search functionality.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation and initial testing of the core admin backend system. This includes:
-   **Admin User Creation**: Successfully created a default admin user.
-   **Admin Login**: Verified that admin login is functional, generating a session token.
-   **User Management**: Confirmed that the admin can retrieve a list of all registered users on the platform.
-   **Financial Overview**: Demonstrated the ability to access financial statistics and overview data.
-   **Platform Analytics**: Verified that platform usage and growth metrics can be retrieved.

However, the very last test of the admin user search functionality resulted in a Failed to get user details: 404: User not found error, indicating that this specific endpoint is not yet working as expected. The AI engineer was in the process of systematically checking and fixing issues, but this particular one remains unresolved.
